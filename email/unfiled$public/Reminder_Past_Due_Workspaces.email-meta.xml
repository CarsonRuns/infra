GSSO Security Account Managers &amp; Sales Managers,

This is a reminder to make sure you keep your workspaces updated with the most recent information, especially the Workspace Expected Book Date.

The Workspace Expected Book Date controls how the Workspace rolls into forecast and pipeline reports and dashboards.  Right now, we have several Active (open) workspaces that are past their Expected Book Date, and are skewing forecast reports.

Please use this report to quick find your Workspaces past their expected book date, click into the workspaces, and update the Book Date, Status and Forecast status.
