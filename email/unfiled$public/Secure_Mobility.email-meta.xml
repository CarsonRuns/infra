    <textOnly>Secure Mobility for the Next-Generation Organisations
Tuesday, 5 April 2011


Smart phones, tablets, and other internet-enabled devices are increasing rapidly worldwide. This means changing work practices, and increased demands on mobile environments. Instead of challenging this IT consumerisation trend, organisations need to find a way to consistently enforce security without affecting productivity, collaboration, and innovation. 

Please join us on Tuesday afternoon on 5 April at local time for an exclusive webcast with IDC analyst Eric Domage. Hear about the latest trends and innovative solutions for successfully securing today&apos;s complex mobile landscape, including applications in the cloud.

This influx of consumer devices in business processes – combined with a highly volatile global security threat landscape – presents you with a new set of security challenges, including:

Defending network boundaries to protect data wherever it resides 
Delivering security management for the Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) trend 
Growing threats originating from consumer products such as tablets and smart phones 
Imagine a secure mobility solution that is everywhere your organisation is. Interested? Find out more and receive a complimentary IDC White Paper exclusively developed for this live webcast.
