    <textOnly>Dear {!Receiving_User.Name},

You are receiving this notification because the Sales Force and Partner Collaboration (SFPC) system is being upgraded.  While the SaleForce.com (SFDC) application will not be down during this time, the integration between SFDC and OMF will.   Any changes made in SFDC will not flow to OMF while the application is down.  They will however, queue up and be processed after the application is back up.
 
Please note the dates and times of the down time:
 
Start Time: Fri 13-May-2005 17:00 PST 
Stop Time: Fri 13-May-2005 19:00 PST
 
The integration will be down for approximately 30-60 minutes within this 2-hour window.
