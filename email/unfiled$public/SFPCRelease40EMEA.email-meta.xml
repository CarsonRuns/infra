The &quot;Deals 
Desk Information&quot; section will be renamed &quot;Non-Standard Requirements&quot; 
 The existing check boxes for Non 
Standard (NS) Product and NS Service for all opportunity records will be 
replaced with 3 new drop-down boxes.  These new questions are mandatory on the creation of an opportunity.

at the Parent level. 
The parent opportunity and phase 
opportunity page layouts will display a web link to direct you to a document 
containing “Non-Standard Deal Definition &amp; Validation 
Procedures”.
