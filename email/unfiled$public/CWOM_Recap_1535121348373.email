Hi [Customer Name],<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time in our meeting. I hope you found the conversation valuable and I look forward to moving the conversation along. Below you will find some additional resources regarding CWOM in order to do a bit of your own research.<br />

In addition, we would like to schedule some time for a demo and possibly trial install of CWOM on your network. Both can be done within the span of an hour long webex. Below are a couple of dates and times that work for us, but we can certainly be flexible if your schedule does not allow for these times:<br />
